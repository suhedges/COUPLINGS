Shaft coupling selection guidance and information:
which kind of coupling is installed on the shafts being connected will depend on the application there are just two basic types rigid couplings which provide a solid connection between two shafts and flexible couplings which may compensate for some misalignment let's look at the rigid types first one of the simplest rigid couplings is the sleeve coupling it is a piece of rod with a hole drilled through it and a keyway cut the full length of the inside holes are drilled to each end for set screws the two shafts are connected by pushing them in at each end and tightening the set screws it allows no movement between the two shafts another type of rigid coupling is the split sleeve coupling this coupling is designed to let the two shafts don't have to be moved to connect them into the coupling it is split down the middle so the two sides can come together around the shafts the third common rigid coupling is the flange coupling these couplings have two flanges one of which is secured to the end of each shaft then the two flanges are bolted together to form the coupling this type of coupling can be used with two shafts of the same size or with shafts of two different sizes by simply boring each flange half to fit its corresponding shaft either the sleeve type coupling or the flange type coupling can be used where shafts can be precisely aligned or where shafts are long enough to counteract the effects of very minor misalignment the problem with using rigid couplings is that two shafts are rarely able to be perfectly aligned in addition many shafts have some end float that the rigid coupling cannot compensate for usually the shafts are aligned as accurately as possible then a flexible coupling is used to compensate for any small degree of shaft misalignment movement or deflection many different types of flexible couplings are used but probably the most common is the chain coupling chain sprockets with specially shortened and hardened teeth are attached to each shaft then a piece of double chain is wrapped around them to make the coupling chain couplings are flexible enough to tolerate about half of one degree of angular misalignment they're relatively rugged and they're economical chain coupling sprockets are available with taper lock hubs and with QD or quick disconnect hubs these special hubs clamp themselves two shafts of different sizes so the bore of the sprocket does not have to fit the shaft precisely another type of chain coupling uses standard stock sprockets like those for power transmission chain drives these sprockets may be taper lock QD or they may have a standard stock bore the chain for this coupling is special Delrin chain which has several advantages it requires no lubrication it allows for one full degree of misalignment and the pins can be removed to disconnect or reconnect the chain although chain couplings are frequently installed without a cover the use of a cover and grease lubrication will extend the life of the coupling in some cases by as much as two or three times coverage may be plastic or they may be metal another common type of flexible coupling is the gear coupling each side of this coupling consists of two parts one part is a gear that is mounted on the shaft the other part a cover has internal teeth that mesh with the teeth of the gears on the shaft the two halves are bolted together to assure correct alignment the gear coupling can also be assembled with shear pins between the halves applying too much rotary force or torque to the coupling shears off the pins the coupling halves along with the shafts they're attached to run free a gear coupling with shear pins is used as a torque limiting device many gear couplings allow one full degree of misalignment to allow for greater misalignment some manufacturers curve the teeth depending upon the curvature as much as three degrees of angular misalignment or possible some manufacturers also provide gear couplings with wider teeth the wider the teeth the more end float the coupling can accommodate another type of flexible coupling has a flexible Center for example one very basic type uses a small piece of rubber hose which is clamped onto each shaft another kind of flexible coupling has a flexible rubber Center disc which is inserted between the two coupling haves a similar coupling has a continuous flexible Center ring with notches that are plugged into each end of the coupling together they make a flexible unit that can allow for as much as two or three degrees of misalignment all the movement takes place in the rubber another style of flexible coupling is referred to as a rubber tire coupling shafts are connected to both sides of the flexible tire and all the flexing occurs in the tire itself another kind of coupling is the steel grit coupling it's two halves are connected with a continuous grid of flexible steel which locks around the center of the coupling but still permits it to move the coupling includes a cover you

hi Bobby Watkins from rueland manufacturing and in this segment we're going to talk about coupling selection factors then we'll go through a few the geometry requirements what are your two shaft sizes are they round shafts of a t-shaped shaft of the chef's teat this is important information to have and your coupling envelope size what is the maximum outside diameter and what is the maximum length that you have to work with the application this information can be helpful in steering us to suggesting the correct type of coupling so again is the application in encoder is it valve actuation is a linear actuator ball school lead screw again the application basics can also help us decide what type of company to first start working at so the misalignment requirements you know parallel misalignment angular axial misalignment requirement identifying the types of misalignment that you're trying to correct with the coupling in the amount of each again is going to steer us to choosing and suggesting the correct coupling to handle the degree of misalignment that you've got in your system mechanical performance requirements the torque required the RPM range speed if you will do you want couplings with a lot of lined up a lot of cushioning a lot of dampening or are you looking for high torque stiffness and accuracy those are important in choosing the proper type coupling and environmental and serviceability requirements so what's the ambient temperature is it in a vacuum is it a corrosive environment and accessibility some applications there's only a a slot or an access hole to get at a coupling to tighten it down if you will and again if you've got a situation where you need the screw location on the coupling in a particular spot because of limited access that's important information as well

first let's take a look at rigid couplings and their uses rigid couplings are used when chefs are positioned in precise lateral and angular alignment they transmit more power but do not allow for shaft misalignment so they should be using high torque applications SD psi offers two types of rigid couplings that Fowler Co type and set screw type set screw type coupling users to set screws to hold the shafts together our fellow club type coupling uses a cap screw for clamping and is a much better solution because it prevents shaft damage the coupling also stays clamps more securely because the Frell our club takes advantage of more surface area than a set screw rigid couplings are limited in their uses because they don't allow for angular or parallel misalignment that's where flexible couplings are much better solution many different types of flexible couplings exist to accommodate a particular design situation let's look at some flexible couplings offered by SD psi bellows couplings feature zero backlash and are designed to correct angular and parallel access misalignment of five degrees 26 degrees as d PSI offers different types of pillows such as the split type or clamp type while bellows couplings also feature the fatwa hub option again chef damage is eliminated and the coupling stays in place mostly Kelly because of increased surface area and it is easy to adjust and readjust while modular bellows coupling features interchangeable hub bushings this can save money as only different size bushings need to be purchased to accommodate very chef diameters another coupling style is the helical design helical couplings are factored from a single piece of material into a vehicle configuration they come in a wide variety of features such as corrosion resistance high torque capacity hi torsional resistance low radial loads and more on miniature helical couplings feature a slick collar with a stylish purple anodized aluminum not the coupling can be easily locked the shaft by tightening the nut with a regular wrench next let's talk about the slit type coupling which looks similar to the helical coupling but instead of a spring-like card configuration it has cuts that are made perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the coupling these couplings have a range of features such as zero backlash I torsional stiffness low moment of inertia and more they also come in a lightweight plastic version that can replace many stainless steel or aluminum couplings with low cost and proved operation in some situations where high parallel misalignment between chefs is necessary and ohlen coupling can be the best solution this coupling compensates for parallel misalignment by incorporating a sliding desk between two hubs bar olden couplings can be purchased in a commercial style with plastic desk between the two hours they feature easy assembly low inertia electrical isolation and art corrosion resistant this can become worn out over time and a new one can be purchased separately at our east or another design situation where a particular coupling can be employed is in a vibration to have any situation st-pierre site offers a couple of different flexible couplings that have anti vibration resistance capabilities this anti vibration flexible coupling absorbed vibration lemonade's resonance increases gain it's a nice alone solution for several motors or stepping motors arnia flex couplings are made of neoprene rubber which gives them good vibration absorption properties our silicone insert couplings of vibration resistant and provide electrical isolation protection through its soft silicone rubber middle insert st PSI has lots of other types of couplings and stocks such as joint cross couplings spline type couplings spider type couplings are these dis type couplings which come in one disc or two dis styles depending on a stiffness required for a particular design another interesting coupling solution is provided by our magnetic companies which use powerful magnets to bring shafts together a quarter of an inch air gap is created between the two coupling halves which allows for angular offset of three degrees at parallel offset of a quarter of an inch more coupling solutions and design ideas can be found on our website at stp SI calm you can also call as the dsi and speak to one of our engineers who can help you decide on the right coupling solution for your next project
